In this session we will continue to look at the interpretation of simple linear regression models outputs, including the quality of the data fit and the checking of model assumptions.

We also look at examples of models with a binary categorical predictor and the interpretation of its coefficients.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the quality of a model fit.

-   Check linear model assumptions.

-   Fit and interpret linear model with categorical predictors using `lm()`

-   Report simple linear model results.
