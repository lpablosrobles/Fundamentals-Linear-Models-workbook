In this session we will familiarize with the basics on the R computing language and the RStudio environment.

# 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand what R and RStudio are.
-   Navigate the RStudio interface.
-   Understand the basics of R language syntax.
-   Write and run basic R code.
-   Create and use scripts and Notebooks to save your code.

# Introduction to R

## 🛠️ What is R?

**R** is a powerful, open-source programming language designed for **statistical computing, data analysis and visualization**. It is widely used among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers.

It was created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the early 1990s and has since become a standard tool in academia, research, and industry.

### **Key Features of R**

-   **Statistical Analysis**: R allows to perform analysis using a wide range of statistical techniques including linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, bayesian methods.

-   **Data Visualization**: R allows the creation of high-quality plots and graphics using specific packages (we will explain below what packages are) like `ggplot2`, `lattice`, and `plotly`.

-   **Extensibility**: Thousands of community provided packages are available via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), covering several fields.

-   **Data Handling**: R includes robust tools for importing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data.

-   **Community Support**: A large and active user community contributes to its development and provides extensive documentation and tutorials.

### Installing R

To work with the programming language, the R interpreter needs to be installed. You can download it from the R homepage, which is:

> <http://cran.r-project.org/>

There are versions available for [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe), [Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.5.1-arm64.pkg) and Linux (several distributions). Select the current version (version 4.5.1 at the start of this course) and install it in your personal computer if you want to use it at home.

*R* installation includes a basic interface environment with a Console to enter commands and write scripts that can be launched using the *R.exe* or *R.app*.

This interface is nonetheless quite limited and it is not normally used for data analysis and script development. You can use this language through lots of different applications and environments (e.g. VSCode, JupyterLabs, etc..) . For this course we will introduce the most commonly use development environment for R: *RStudio*.

## 💻 What is RStudio?

RStudio is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for R, that makes coding in R and management of data analysis projects easier.

RStudio is a product developed by a company called posit, but that provides a free, open source **RStudio Desktop** version that can be downloaded here:

> <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

As with R, there are versions available for Windows, Mac and several Linux distributions.

Once we launch RStudio, you can distinguish four different areas:

-   **Console**: Where R code is executed, you can type commands and see their output.

-   **Source**: Where you write and save scripts, Notebooks.

-   **Environments**: Includes tabs to inspect variables and inspect the command history as well as access tutorials.

-   **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer**: Includes tabs for file navigation, plotting, package management, and help.

We will familiarize with the interface during the exercises in the Workgroup sessions, but you can find a full description and information the following resources provided in the Posit website:

> [RStudio IDE User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html)

## 🌐Using R and RStudio on the web

If you don't want to install in your own computer, you can use the Posit Cloud environment. that provides a Cloud Free option. This is the approach we will use in this course, so that you can access your work from anywhere.

All assignments will be performed in Posit Cloud where I can follow your progress and assist in case of issues.
