# Workbook organization

The workbook is organized in six chapters to cover the Workgroup sessions.

For each workgroup, a number of descriptive sections are included explaining the main concepts and including code examples. The idea is that you read through the description and try the code examples and exercises yourself as you go through in the RStudio environment.

At the end of each workgroup section there is an introduction and description of an Assignment, to be started during the class and finished at home (if required).

Answer keys to the assignments will be included in the relevant Workgroup section after the due date of each of them.
