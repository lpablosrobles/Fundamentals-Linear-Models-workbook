# R Scripts

## Saving scripts

## Executing scripts

# R Markdown and Notebooks

## Basic syntax of R Markdown

## Notebooks

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

::: callout-caution
Beware that the environment of a Notebook is not the same as the R session environment!
