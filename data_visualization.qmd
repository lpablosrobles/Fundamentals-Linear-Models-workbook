# ðŸ“ŠData visualization in R: introduction to ggplot

## Basic Plotting

\> \*\*Note on ggplot2:\*\* The intention of this example was to show the power of \`ggplot2\` to produce graphs of all types. It is beyond the scope of this course to learn how to use it and you are \*\*not\*\* expected to know it for the exams. For the interested readers there are several books and resources on the topic:

\- \[\*R Graphics Cookbook\*\](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do) by Winston Chang

\- \[\*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\*\](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387981413) by Hadley Wickham
