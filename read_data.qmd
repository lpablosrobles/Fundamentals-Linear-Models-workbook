# Reading and Saving data in R

## Reading data from files {#sec-r-read}

We cover below examples for **importing data in R**, covering the most common methods and packages:

## Data from text files

The most generic function to read data from a text file is `read.table()` . The arguments allow to define if the data includes a header (i.e. a first row with the names of the columns/variables) and the separator used.

For example, if we want to load a file called `file.txt` , TAB separated, we will use the function below.

``` r
data <- read.table("file.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

### Data from CSV files

Many experimental data is saved in a text or CSV (Comma separated) file. The best method to read data from these files is to use the `readr` package that is loaded as part of the `tidyverse` .

``` r
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("yourfile.csv")  # Load a CSV file  
```

If your data is tab-separated, you can use the function `read_tsv()` . By default, the functions expect that the first row contains the names of the columns/variables to be read. If that is not the case, you should modify the argument `col_names = FALSE` .

## Data from Excel files

The best way to read Excel files is using the `readxl` package.

``` r
# Using readxl 
library(readxl) 
data <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

## Data in R files

## Data from SPSS

The `haven` package to read directly `.sav` files from SPSS.

``` r
# Install and load the package
install.packages("haven")
library(haven)

# Read the SPSS .sav file
data <- read_sav("path/to/your/file.sav")
```

# Saving data

## Save to R format

## Save to text
