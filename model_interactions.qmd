# Modeling interactions in linear models {.unnumbered}

### Interpretation

-    `freq:classverb` = difference in the slope of frequency for verbs vs. nouns.

    If significant, it means the slope of frequency depends on lexical class.

## Visualising the Interaction

We can plot predicted values to make interpretation clearer.

Writing

newdat \<- expand_grid(\
freq = seq(min(dat\$freq), max(dat\$freq), length.out = 30),\
class = levels(dat\$class)\
) %\>%\
mutate(pred = predict(m3, newdata = .))

ggplot(dat, aes(freq, rt, color = class)) +\
geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\
geom_line(data = newdat, aes(y = pred), size = 1.2) +\
labs(title = "Interaction Between Frequency and Class",\
y = "Predicted Reaction Time (ms)")
