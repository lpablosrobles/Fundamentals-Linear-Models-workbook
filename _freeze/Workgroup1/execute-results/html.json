It is widely used among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers. To work with the programming language, the R interpreter needs to be installed. You can download it from the R homepage, which is:\n\n> <http://cran.r-project.org/>\n\nThere are versions available for [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe), [Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.5.1-arm64.pkg) and Linux (several distributions). Select the current version (version 4.5.1 at the start of this course) and install it in your personal computer if you want to use it at home.\n\n*R* installation includes a basic interface environment with a Console to enter commands and write scripts that can be launched using the *R.exe* or *R.app*.\n\n## ![](images/clipboard-347489880.png)\n\nThis interface is nonetheless quite limited and it is not normally used for data analysis and script development. You can use this language through lots of different applications and environments (e.g. VSCode, JupyterLabs, etc..) . For this course we will introduce the most commonly use development environment for R: *RStudio*.\n\n## 💻 What is RStudio?\n\nRStudio is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for R, that makes coding in R and management of data analysis projects easier.\n\nRStudio is a product developed by a company called posit, but that provides a free, open source **RStudio Desktop** version that can be downloaded here:\n\n> <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\nAs with R, there are versions available for Windows, Mac and several Linux distributions.\n\nOnce we launch RStudio, you can distinguish four different areas:\n\n-   **Console**: Where R code is executed, you can type commands and see their output.\n\n-   **Source**: Where you write and save scripts, Notebooks.\n\n-   **Environments**: Includes tabs to inspect variables and inspect the command history as well as access tutorials.\n\n-   **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer**: Includes tabs for file navigation, plotting, package management, and help.\n\n![RStudio Environment (extracted from [RStudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html \"RStudio User Guide\"))](images/clipboard-4013327463.png)\n\nWe will familiarize with the interface during the exercises in the Workgroup sessions, but you can find a full description and information the following resources provided in the Posit website:\n\n> [RStudio IDE User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html)\n\n## 🌐Using R and RStudio on the web\n\nIf you don't want to install in your own computer, you can use the Posit Cloud environment. that provides a Cloud Free option. This is the approach we will use in this course, so that you can access your work from anywhere.\n\nAll assignments will be performed in Posit Cloud where I can follow your progress and assist in case of issues.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 📝 Exercise1: Connect to Posit Cloud {#sec-📝-exercise1}\n\nIn order to use Posit Cloud you need to register for this course following the link below.\n\n<https://posit.cloud/spaces/681791/join?access_code=Da9RyPvqyx7Jymq_aHZpKYwBuJJ-45h5bjS1Y7tq>\n\nYou will be directed to the following page. Select the sign-up option and create your account.\n\n![Posit Cloud Sign-in page](images/PositSignIn.png)\n\nOnce you sign-in you should see the course project as in the image below:\n\n![](images/PositCloudProject.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nOpen it and explore the RStudio interface.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# ✍️ R Syntax\n\n## Commands and operators\n\nR\n\n```         \n>\n```\n\nThat's the ***command prompt***. When you see this, it means that R is waiting patiently for you to do something!\n\nOne of the easiest things you can do with R is use it as a simple calculator, so it's a good place to start. For instance, try typing `10 + 20`, and hitting enter.[^workgroup1-1] When you do this, you've entered a ***command***, and R will \"execute\" that command. What you see on screen now will be this:\n\n[^workgroup1-1]: Seriously. If you're in a position to do so, open up R and start typing. The simple act of typing it rather than \"just reading\" makes a big difference. It makes the concepts more concrete, and it ties the abstract ideas (programming and statistics) to the actual context in which you need to use them. Statistics is something you *do*, not just something you read about in a textbook.\n\n``` r\n> 10 + 20\n[1] 30\n```\n\nNot a lot of surprises in this extract. But there's a few things worth talking about, even with such a simple example. Firstly, it's important that you understand how to read the extract. In this example, what *I* typed was the `10 + 20` part. I didn't type the `>` symbol: that's just the R command prompt and isn't part of the actual command. And neither did I type the `[1] 30` part. That's what R printed out in response to my command.\n\nSecondly, it's important to understand how the output is formatted. Obviously, the correct answer to the sum `10 + 20` is `30`, and not surprisingly R has printed that out as part of its response. But it's also printed out this `[1]` part, which probably doesn't make a lot of sense to you right now. You're going to see that a lot. I'll talk about what this means in a bit more detail later on, but for now you can think of `[1] 30` as if R were saying \"the answer to the 1st question you asked is 30\". That's not quite the truth, but it's close enough for now. And in any case it's not really very interesting at the moment: we only asked R to calculate one thing, so obviously there's only one answer printed on the screen. Later on this will change, and the `[1]` part will start to make a bit more sense. For now, I just don't want you to get confused or concerned by it.\n\n## Variables\n\n``` r\n# This is a comment \nx <- 5       # Assign 5 to variable x \ny <- 10      # Assign 10 to variable y \nz <- x + y   # Add x and y \nprint(z)     # Print the result \n```\n\n## Functions\n\n## Loops and conditional statements\n\n## Data types\n\n### Basic types\n\n### Vectors and lists\n\n### Dataframes and tibbles\n\n# 📦 Libraries and Packages\n\nOne of the big benefits of *R* in comparison with other statistics packages is its open nature. The functionality is easily extended by groups all around the world by developing libraries that can be easily installed and used.\n\nFor this exercise, we use a library (created by Baayen) that contains some utilities and a few sample datasets with linguistics examples.\n\nThe library should be loaded to be used using the *library()* function.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(languageR)\n```\n\n## Install and Use a Package\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\nmtcars %>% filter(cyl == 6) %>% summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg)) \n```\n\n## \n\n# Working with Scripts\n\n# Working with Notebooks\n\n# 📝 Exercises\n\n## 1. Basic Calculations\n\nOpen RStudio and type the following in the console:\n\n-   Add 15 and 27\n\n-   Multiply 6 by 9\n\n-   Divide 100 by 4\n\n## 2. Create Variables\n\n``` r\na <- 12 \nb <- 8 \nc <- a * b \nprint(c) \n```\n\nTry changing the values of `a` and `b` and re-run the code.\n\n## 3. Create a dataframe\n\nCreate a dataframe coming up with a sample data of your own (possibly made up) including 4 columns and 6 rows: one column with a factor with two levels, another column with a factor with 3 levels and two columns with numeric values.\n\nYou can create a dataframe in several ways, but below you see an example on the steps to create a dataframe based on on vectors.\n\nCreate individual variables with vectors including the values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounAnimacy<-c(\"animate\",\"inanimate\",\"inanimate\",\"animate\",\"animate\",\"animate\")\nNounAnimacy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"animate\"   \"inanimate\" \"inanimate\" \"animate\"   \"animate\"   \"animate\"  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``` r\nNounGender<-c(\"feminine\",\"masculine\",\"neuter\",\"masculine\",\"feminine\",\"feminine\")\nNounGender\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounGender<-c(\"feminine\",\"masculine\",\"neuter\",\"masculine\",\"feminine\",\"feminine\")\nNounGender\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"feminine\"  \"masculine\" \"neuter\"    \"masculine\" \"feminine\"  \"feminine\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounLength<-c(6,7,4,5,8,6)\nNounLength\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6 7 4 5 8 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounFrequency<-c(638,799,390,569,567,665)\nNounFrequency\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 638 799 390 569 567 665\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the output above, data in the variables *NounAnimacy* and *NounGender* are considered as words, or literal strings. The next step is to indicate they are factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounAnimacy<-as.factor(NounAnimacy)\nNounAnimacy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] animate   inanimate inanimate animate   animate   animate  \nLevels: animate inanimate\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNounGender<-as.factor(NounGender)\nNounGender\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] feminine  masculine neuter    masculine feminine  feminine \nLevels: feminine masculine neuter\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see by the output produced, now the variables are considered as factors, and *Levels* indicate the unique values that the predictor takes.\n\nWith the variables above, we can now create a dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDataexample<-data.frame(NounAnimacy,NounGender,NounLength,NounFrequency)\nDataexample\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  NounAnimacy NounGender NounLength NounFrequency\n1     animate   feminine          6           638\n2   inanimate  masculine          7           799\n3   inanimate     neuter          4           390\n4     animate  masculine          5           569\n5     animate   feminine          8           567\n6     animate   feminine          6           665\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Reading material\n\n-   Basics on R programming:\n\n    -   Chapter 1, Introduction to R, from Bodo Winter’s book.\n\n    -   Sections 2 to 8 on [R basic Tutorial by UMC Utrecht](http://r-tutorial.nl/)\n\nA good starters reference for R is the book “R for Data Science” (Wickham, H., Çetinkaya-Rundel, M., & Grolemund, G.
