In this session we will examine how to execute and interpret multiple linear regression models.

As described in the lecture, multiple linera regression allows us to create models to predict a continuous outcome using **two or more predictors (categorical or continuous)** or in the case of a **single categorical predictor with more** **than two levels.**

We will look at examples of models with a combination of categorical and continuous predictor and the interpretation of its coefficients in each of the cases.

# 🧠 Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Fit and interpret a multiple linear model with categorical and continuous predictors using `lm()` .

-   Understand concept of main effects and marginal means.

-   Visualize models with several predictors.

-   Perform post-hoc tests to evaluate the effects.

-   Report multiple linear model results.
