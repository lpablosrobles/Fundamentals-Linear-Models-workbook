In this session we will start exploring the analysis of correlations between variables and applying the linear model concepts explained in the lecture with R.

We start looking in a bit more detail into the visual exploration of relationships using scatterplots.

# 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Create and format scatter plots with `ggplot`.

-   Visualize linear model fits with data.

-   Understand concept, calculation and significance checking of Pearson's Correlation Coefficient in R.

-   Understand basic linear models formula nomenclature.

-   Fit linear model with a continuous or interval predictor using `lm()`

-   Familiarize with the output of the `lm()` function.
