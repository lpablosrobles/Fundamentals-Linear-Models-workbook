    "text": "üõ†Ô∏è What is R?\nR is a powerful, open-source programming language designed for statistical computing, data analysis and visualization. It is widely used among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers.\nIt was created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the early 1990s and has since become a standard tool in academia, research, and industry.\n\nKey Features of R\n\nStatistical Analysis: R allows to perform analysis using a wide range of statistical techniques including linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, bayesian methods.\nData Visualization: R allows the creation of high-quality plots and graphics using specific packages (we will explain below what packages are) like ggplot2, lattice, and plotly.\nExtensibility: Thousands of community provided packages are available via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), covering several fields.\nData Handling: R includes robust tools for importing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data.\nCommunity Support: A large and active user community contributes to its development and provides extensive documentation and tutorials.\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nTo work with the programming language, the R interpreter needs to be installed. You can download it from the R homepage, which is:\n\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n\nThere are versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux (several distributions). Select the current version (version 4.5.1 at the start of this course) and install it in your personal computer if you want to use it at home.\nR installation includes a basic interface environment with a Console to enter commands and write scripts that can be launched using the R.exe or R.app.\n\nThis interface is nonetheless quite limited and it is not normally used for data analysis and script development. You can use this language through lots of different applications and environments (e.g.¬†VSCode, JupyterLabs, etc..) . For this course we will introduce the most commonly use development environment for R: RStudio.",

This is the command prompt, indicating that the system us ready to execute an instruction or command.\nR syntax is relatively simple and, although daunting if you have never programmed before when you first encounter it, you will quickly get acquainted with it.\nHere‚Äôs a simple example of how R code looks. In the following sections we explain some basic concepts on the syntax and notation.\nBefore going forward, note that lines of code starting with the symbol # are not interpreted.

    "section": "\n2.4 Functions",
    "text": "2.4 Functions\nFunctions perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called arguments and return outputs. They are called using parentheses. For example, the function mean() in R calculates the mean of the elements we provide as input.\n\n# We can specify a list of numbers\nmean(c(1,2,3,4))\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nOr, more useful, we can provide a variable containing values:\n\n# we defined the variable numbers before\nmean(numbers)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nThe parameters of a function and normally called arguments. You can either manually specify a function‚Äôs arguments or use the function‚Äôs default values. In the examples above mean() and sum() are simple functions with not many arguments, but this is not normally the case.\nTo know the arguments of a function you can use the R help. There are two ways to access the help pages for a function:\n\n\nUse the operator ? followed by the function name in the console: If you type the instruction ?mean the help page for the mean() function will open in the RStudio Help panel as in the image below:\n\n\nYou can of course directly open the Help tab and search for the function of interest.\n\nAs you can see above, mean() actually has two other arguments, trim and na.rm . The arguments have a default value, so if we don‚Äôt explicitly include them in the function call, they will use that value. Let‚Äôs look at an example using na.rm :\nR has a special value called NA , which means ‚ÄúNot Available‚Äù and it is used to represent missing values on the data. In experimental work is often the case that some data point is lost or corrupted and we have incomplete datasets. Let‚Äôs assume you had performed an online experiment that computed the reaction time in miliseconds of 10 participants, and one value was not available as per the vector below:\n\nrt &lt;- c(234.2, 127.5, 256.2, NA, 287.1, 145.6, 358.9, 200.1, 398.3, 178.3)\n\nLet‚Äôs try to calculate the average reaction time of your data using mean():\n\nmean(rt)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe function tries to calculate the average, but when one value is not available (NA) the result is also NA . In the help in the image below we see there is an argument na.rm that we can use to ignore the missing elements in the data:\n\nmean(rt, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 242.9111\n\n\nNow the function worked and summed all the numbers and divided them by 9, ignoring the missing data, in the calculation of the average.\nWe‚Äôll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you‚Äôll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors, so don‚Äôt panic.\nFinally an advanced note to make you aware that you can define your own functions. The following code defines a new function called add() that, well, adds two numbers:\n\nadd &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  return(a + b)\n}\n\nOnce you have defined the function, you can use it as any other in R:\n\nadd(3.5, 2.5)\n\n[1] 6",

This dataset is based on a more general dataset called spanish also included in the library, from Spassova, M. S. (2006) Las marcas sintacticas de atribucion forense de autoria de textos escritos en espanol, Masters thesis, Institut Universitari de Linguistica Aplicada, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona\n\n8.1.1 Display dataframe\nTo view the contents of a dataset we can simply write the name of the dataset in the console\n\n  spanishMeta\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n1       C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972        Cela\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n6       M        1943 X14463gll    1986   3013     Mendoza\n7       M        1943 X14464gll    1992   3049     Mendoza\n8       M        1943 X14465gll    1989   3042     Mendoza\n9       M        1943 X14466gll    1982   3039     Mendoza\n10      M        1943 X14467gll    2002   3045     Mendoza\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n14      V        1936 X14475gll    1987   3016 VargasLLosa\n15      V        1936 X14476gll    1981   3054 VargasLLosa\n\n\nIf we have a lot of data, the console display will be very long. Then you can use the head() function to only see the first few rows of the dataset\n\nhead(spanishMeta)\n\n  Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords FullName\n1      C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972     Cela\n2      C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040     Cela\n3      C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066     Cela\n4      C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044     Cela\n5      C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053     Cela\n6      M        1943 X14463gll    1986   3013  Mendoza\n\n\nBy default the function shows the first 6 rows of the dataset. if you look at the options of the function using help(head), you can see that there is a parameter (called argument in the vocabulary of R) n that can be used to indicate the number of rows to show. For the exercise, to show 4 rows, you can use:\n\nhead(spanishMeta, n=4)\n\n  Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords FullName\n1      C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972     Cela\n2      C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040     Cela\n3      C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066     Cela\n4      C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044     Cela\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Extract column names\nThere a number of functions that allow to inspect data sets: * str(): provides a brief description of the data set variables and contents * names(): lists the names of the variables * summary(): gives basic summary statistics for every variable (we will explore this in the next assignment) * head(): shows the first rows of the dataset (as we saw above) * tail(): shows the last rows of the dataset\nIn the assignment it was asked to list the names of the variables in the dataset. The easiest way is to use the names() function\n\nnames(spanishMeta)\n\n[1] \"Author\"      \"YearOfBirth\" \"TextName\"    \"PubDate\"     \"Nwords\"     \n[6] \"FullName\"   \n\n\n\n8.1.3 Extract vector\nAccessing the variables of a dataset is possible using the $ operator. So for example, to list the contents of the PubDate\n\nspanishMeta$PubDate\n\n [1] 1983 1951 1956 1948 1942 1986 1992 1989 1982 2002 1965 1963 1977 1987 1981\n\n\nIn the exercise it was asked to take this information and include it in a variable called PublicationDate. Using the above notation this is simply done as\n\nPublicationDate&lt;-spanishMeta$PubDate \nPublicationDate\n\n [1] 1983 1951 1956 1948 1942 1986 1992 1989 1982 2002 1965 1963 1977 1987 1981\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Sort a vector\nYou can sort the vector using the sort() function as below.\n\nsort(PublicationDate)\n\n [1] 1942 1948 1951 1956 1963 1965 1977 1981 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 1992 2002\n\n\n\nsort(PublicationDate,decreasing = TRUE)\n\n [1] 2002 1992 1989 1987 1986 1983 1982 1981 1977 1965 1963 1956 1951 1948 1942\n\n\nFinally, there are many functions available to work, modify, and access dataframes. As an example let‚Äôs see how we could select a part of the dataframe based on a criteria. If we want to select the entries that were published before 1980 for example, we can do the following\n\nspanishMeta[spanishMeta$PubDate&lt;1980,]\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n\n\nYou can also use the subset() function to make a selection\n\nsubset(spanishMeta, PubDate&lt;1980)\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n\n\nFor all the operations above you can also use pipes:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nPublicationDate %&gt;% sort\n\n [1] 1942 1948 1951 1956 1963 1965 1977 1981 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 1992 2002\n\n\n\nPublicationDate %&gt;% sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n\n [1] 2002 1992 1989 1987 1986 1983 1982 1981 1977 1965 1963 1956 1951 1948 1942\n\n\n\nspanishMeta %&gt;% filter(PubDate&lt;1980)\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa",
