    "text": "üõ†Ô∏è What is R?\nR is a powerful, open-source programming language designed for statistical computing, data analysis and visualization. It is widely used among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers.\nIt was created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the early 1990s and has since become a standard tool in academia, research, and industry.\n\nKey Features of R\n\nStatistical Analysis: R allows to perform analysis using a wide range of statistical techniques including linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, bayesian methods.\nData Visualization: R allows the creation of high-quality plots and graphics using specific packages (we will explain below what packages are) like ggplot2, lattice, and plotly.\nExtensibility: Thousands of community provided packages are available via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), covering several fields.\nData Handling: R includes robust tools for importing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data.\nCommunity Support: A large and active user community contributes to its development and provides extensive documentation and tutorials.\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nTo work with the programming language, the R interpreter needs to be installed. You can download it from the R homepage, which is:\n\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n\nThere are versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux (several distributions). Select the current version (version 4.5.1 at the start of this course) and install it in your personal computer if you want to use it at home.\nR installation includes a basic interface environment with a Console to enter commands and write scripts that can be launched using the R.exe or R.app.\n\nThis interface is nonetheless quite limited and it is not normally used for data analysis and script development. You can use this language through lots of different applications and environments (e.g.¬†VSCode, JupyterLabs, etc..) . For this course we will introduce the most commonly use development environment for R: RStudio.",

This is the command prompt, indicating that the system us ready to execute an instruction or command.\nR syntax is relatively simple and, although daunting if you have never programmed before when you first encounter it, you will quickly get acquainted with it.\nHere‚Äôs a simple example of how R code looks. In the following sections we explain some basic concepts on the syntax and notation.\nBefore going forward, note that lines of code starting with the symbol # are not interpreted. This is use to introduce comments in your code for readability and documentation. We will come to that later when we talk about scripts and notebooks.\nEvery instruction to enter in the command prompt is called a command.\nA simple command is to perform an arithmetic operations like for example:\n1 + 2\n\n[1] 3\nThe command just calculated the addition of the two numbers. In this example, we used the operator + to do so.\nWe include a list below of the basic operators in R, grouped by category:s. Do not worry if not all are understandable yet:\n1. Arithmetic Operators\nUsed for basic mathematical operations:\n2. Relational (Comparison) Operators\nUsed to compare values:\n3.

    "section": "\n1.3 Functions",
    "text": "1.3 Functions\nFunctions perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called arguments and return outputs. They are called using parentheses. For example, the function mean() in R calculates the mean of the elements we provide as input.\n\n# We can specify a list of numbers\nmean(c(1,2,3,4))\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nOr, more useful, we can provide a variable containing values:\n\n# we defined the variable numbers before\nmean(numbers)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nThe parameters of a function and normally called arguments. You can either manually specify a function‚Äôs arguments or use the function‚Äôs default values. In the examples above mean() and sum() are simple functions with not many arguments, but this is not normally the case.\nTo know the arguments of a function you can use the R help. There are two ways to access the help pages for a function:\n\n\nUse the operator ? followed by the function name in the console: If you type the instruction ?mean the help page for the mean() function will open in the RStudio Help panel as in the image below:\n\n\nYou can of course directly open the Help tab and search for the function of interest.\n\nAs you can see above, mean() actually has two other arguments, trim and na.rm . The arguments have a default value, so if we don‚Äôt explicitly include them in the function call, they will use that value. Let‚Äôs look at an example using na.rm :\nR has a special value called NA , which means ‚ÄúNot Available‚Äù and it is used to represent missing values on the data. In experimental work is often the case that some data point is lost or corrupted and we have incomplete datasets. Let‚Äôs assume you had performed an online experiment that computed the reaction time in miliseconds of 10 participants, and one value was not available as per the vector below:\n\nrt &lt;- c(234.2, 127.5, 256.2, NA, 287.1, 145.6, 358.9, 200.1, 398.3, 178.3)\n\nLet‚Äôs try to calculate the average reaction time of your data using mean():\n\nmean(rt)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe function tries to calculate the average, but when one value is not available (NA) the result is also NA . In the help in the image below we see there is an argument na.rm that we can use to ignore the missing elements in the data:\n\nmean(rt, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 242.9111\n\n\nNow the function worked and summed all the numbers and divided them by 9, ignoring the missing data, in the calculation of the average.\nWe‚Äôll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you‚Äôll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors, so don‚Äôt panic.\nFinally an advanced note to make you aware that you can define your own functions. The following code defines a new function called add() that, well, adds two numbers:\n\nadd &lt;- function(a, b) {\n  return(a + b)\n}\n\nOnce you have defined the function, you can use it as any other in R:\n\nadd(3.5, 2.5)\n\n[1] 6",

Categorical data consists of variables that have a fixed number of unique values, known as¬†levels. These are typically used for any variable that classifies observations into groups. We will use factors extensively in the analysis of data\nWe convert a vector into a factor by using the factor() function. Let‚Äôs look at one example.\n\n\n1.4.1 üìù Exercise 2: Creating a dataframe with factors\nWe want to create a dataset of six words, collecting data of the animacy, gender, length and frequency of the word.\nFirst, we create individual variables with vectors including the values\n\nNounAnimacy&lt;-c(\"animate\",\"inanimate\",\"inanimate\",\"animate\",\"animate\",\"animate\") \nNounAnimacy \n\n[1] \"animate\"   \"inanimate\" \"inanimate\" \"animate\"   \"animate\"   \"animate\"  \n\n\n\nNounGender&lt;-c(\"feminine\",\"masculine\",\"neuter\",\"masculine\",\"feminine\",\"feminine\") \nNounGender\n\n[1] \"feminine\"  \"masculine\" \"neuter\"    \"masculine\" \"feminine\"  \"feminine\" \n\n\n\nNounLength&lt;-c(6,7,4,5,8,6) \nNounLength \n\n[1] 6 7 4 5 8 6\n\nNounFrequency&lt;-c(638,799,390,569,567,665) \nNounFrequency\n\n[1] 638 799 390 569 567 665\n\n\nAs you can see from the output above, data in the variables NounAnimacy and NounGender are considered as words, or literal strings.
