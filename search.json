To work with the programming language, the R interpreter needs to be installed. You can download it from the R homepage, which is:\n\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n\nThere are versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux (several distributions). Select the current version (version 4.5.1 at the start of this course) and install it in your personal computer if you want to use it at home.\nR installation includes a basic interface environment with a Console to enter commands and write scripts that can be launched using the R.exe or R.app.",

You can either manually specify a function‚Äôs arguments or use the function‚Äôs default values.\n\nFor example, the function seq() in R generates a sequence of numbers. If you just run seq() it will return the value 1. That doesn‚Äôt seem very useful! This is because the default arguments are set as seq(from = 1, to = 1). Thus, if you don‚Äôt pass in different values for from and to to change this behavior, R just assumes all you want is the number 1. You can change the argument values by updating the values after the = sign. If we try out seq(from = 2, to = 5) we get the result 2 3 4 5 that we might expect.\nWe‚Äôll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you‚Äôll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors. To further assist you in understanding when a function is mentioned in the book, we‚Äôll also include the () after them as we did with seq() above.",

This dataset is based on a more general dataset called spanish also included in the library, from Spassova, M. S. (2006) Las marcas sintacticas de atribucion forense de autoria de textos escritos en espanol, Masters thesis, Institut Universitari de Linguistica Aplicada, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona\nDisplay dataframe\nTo view the contents of a dataset we can simply write the name of the dataset in the console\n\n  spanishMeta\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n1       C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972        Cela\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n6       M        1943 X14463gll    1986   3013     Mendoza\n7       M        1943 X14464gll    1992   3049     Mendoza\n8       M        1943 X14465gll    1989   3042     Mendoza\n9       M        1943 X14466gll    1982   3039     Mendoza\n10      M        1943 X14467gll    2002   3045     Mendoza\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n14      V        1936 X14475gll    1987   3016 VargasLLosa\n15      V        1936 X14476gll    1981   3054 VargasLLosa\n\n\nIf we have a lot of data, the console display will be very long. Then you can use the head() function to only see the first few rows of the dataset\n\nhead(spanishMeta)\n\n  Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords FullName\n1      C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972     Cela\n2      C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040     Cela\n3      C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066     Cela\n4      C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044     Cela\n5      C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053     Cela\n6      M        1943 X14463gll    1986   3013  Mendoza\n\n\nBy default the function shows the first 6 rows of the dataset. if you look at the options of the function using help(head), you can see that there is a parameter (called argument in the vocabulary of R) n that can be used to indicate the number of rows to show. For the exercise, to show 4 rows, you can use:\n\nhead(spanishMeta, n=4)\n\n  Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords FullName\n1      C        1916 X14458gll    1983   2972     Cela\n2      C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040     Cela\n3      C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066     Cela\n4      C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044     Cela\n\n\nExtract column names\nThere a number of functions that allow to inspect data sets: * str(): provides a brief description of the data set variables and contents * names(): lists the names of the variables * summary(): gives basic summary statistics for every variable (we will explore this in the next assignment) * head(): shows the first rows of the dataset (as we saw above) * tail(): shows the last rows of the dataset\nIn the assignment it was asked to list the names of the variables in the dataset. The easiest way is to use the names() function\n\nnames(spanishMeta)\n\n[1] \"Author\"      \"YearOfBirth\" \"TextName\"    \"PubDate\"     \"Nwords\"     \n[6] \"FullName\"   \n\n\nExtract vector\nAccessing the variables of a dataset is possible using the $ operator. So for example, to list the contents of the PubDate\n\nspanishMeta$PubDate\n\n [1] 1983 1951 1956 1948 1942 1986 1992 1989 1982 2002 1965 1963 1977 1987 1981\n\n\nIn the exercise it was asked to take this information and include it in a variable called PublicationDate. Using the above notation this is simply done as\n\nPublicationDate&lt;-spanishMeta$PubDate \nPublicationDate\n\n [1] 1983 1951 1956 1948 1942 1986 1992 1989 1982 2002 1965 1963 1977 1987 1981\n\n\nSort a vector\nYou can sort the vector using the sort() function as below.\n\nsort(PublicationDate)\n\n [1] 1942 1948 1951 1956 1963 1965 1977 1981 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 1992 2002\n\n\n\nsort(PublicationDate,decreasing = TRUE)\n\n [1] 2002 1992 1989 1987 1986 1983 1982 1981 1977 1965 1963 1956 1951 1948 1942\n\n\nFinally, there are many functions available to work, modify, and access dataframes. As an example let‚Äôs see how we could select a part of the dataframe based on a criteria. If we want to select the entries that were published before 1980 for example, we can do the following\n\nspanishMeta[spanishMeta$PubDate&lt;1980,]\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n\n\nYou can also use the subset() function to make a selection\n\nsubset(spanishMeta, PubDate&lt;1980)\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n\n\nFor all the operations above you can also use pipes:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nPublicationDate %&gt;% sort\n\n [1] 1942 1948 1951 1956 1963 1965 1977 1981 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 1992 2002\n\n\n\nPublicationDate %&gt;% sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n\n [1] 2002 1992 1989 1987 1986 1983 1982 1981 1977 1965 1963 1956 1951 1948 1942\n\n\n\nspanishMeta %&gt;% filter(PubDate&lt;1980)\n\n   Author YearOfBirth  TextName PubDate Nwords    FullName\n2       C        1916 X14459gll    1951   3040        Cela\n3       C        1916 X14460gll    1956   3066        Cela\n4       C        1916 X14461gll    1948   3044        Cela\n5       C        1916 X14462gll    1942   3053        Cela\n11      V        1936 X14472gll    1965   3037 VargasLLosa\n12      V        1936 X14473gll    1963   3067 VargasLLosa\n13      V        1936 X14474gll    1977   3020 VargasLLosa\n\n\nFor self-study and exploration look at this website to get information on basic manipulation of dataframes.",
