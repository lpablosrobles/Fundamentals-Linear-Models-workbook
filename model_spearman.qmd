# Spearman's rank correlation {.unnumbered}

As we saw in the last lecture, when data does not have a linear relationship, the use of Pearson's correlation is not adequate.

An alternative is to use **Spearman's rank correlation** or **Spearman's rho**, which assesses that two variables are **monotonically** related, meaning that there is a positive relationship (one variable increases corresponds to increase on the other) or negatively (two variables vary inversely) even though their relationship is not linear.

If we consider back the example in Workgroup #4 of \\data from a psycholinguistic study on the reading comprehension of words as a function of frequency part of the English Lexicon Project, described in the the @winter2019statistics textbook Chapter 4.1.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

elp_data <- read.csv("./data/ELP_full_length_frequency.csv")
elp_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = Log10Freq, y = RT)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=1/20) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

The Frequency and Reading Time have a non-linear relationship, however clearly are related. Looking at the residuals of a model fit on this data, they clearly violate the linear regression model assumptions.

```{r}
elp_model<-lm(RT~Log10Freq, data=elp_data)
plot(elp_model, which=1)
```

For this data, we can use Spearman's rho to quantify the relationship.

**Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ)** quantifies the **monotonic association** between two variables based on **ranked values**, not raw numeric magnitudes. It is therefore:

-    Non-parametric (no assumption of normality or linearity).

-   Robust to outliers and skewed distributions.

-   Appropriate when the relationship is monotonic but not necessarily linear.

-   Useful when variables are ordinal or continuous but violate Pearson’s assumptions.

We can calculate it using the same function as the one used for the Pearson's correlation coefficient `cor.test()`

```{r}
cor.test(elp_data$Log10Freq,elp_data$RT)
```

## Interpretation of the output:

-   **ρ = −0.62** indicates a **negative monotonic association**:\
    As word frequency increases, reaction times tend to decrease (participants recognize more frequent words faster).

-   The **p-value \< .001** indicates that the association is statistically significant.

-   Because Spearman’s rho is rank-based, this finding is robust to the strong skew and occasional outliers typical of RT data.

## APA-style reporting

Results could be reported as follows:

> Inspection of the scatterplot and residuals of a linear model fit suggested a monotonic but non-linear pattern relationship between the logarithmically transformed word frequency and the reading time of a lexical decision task in the English Lexicon Project.
>
> A Spearman rank-order correlation was conducted to assess the monotonic relationship. There was a **moderate, negative correlation** between the variables, **ρ = –.62, 95%CI\[-.626,.612\], p \< .001**, indicating that higher-frequency words were responded to more quickly.
